# oberon-oberpoll-slackbot

Oberon version of Simple Poll

## Local Development

Install the app into a certain slack channel, whether it be your personal one or an oberon one.

Install (localtunnel)[https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel] or (ngrok)[https://ngrok.com].
Then go into the oberon slack app directory and set up the interactive messages URL to the following:
> https://<localtunnelurlhere>.com/slack/actions.

Reinstall your app to the environment.

Start the node service.

Now the bot is running, and can also receive actions from the buttons provided in the message.
